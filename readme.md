## Why Vite
Vite is a front-end tool that offers a faster workflow for developing web apps. It's an environment for various frameworks, such as Vue, React, Angular, but also Vanilla JavaScript. Not only does it speed up the front-end development experience, it can also integrate with back-end tools. All in all, Vite allows for increased productivity and thus a more efficient development process. 


## Setup
To set up Vite, you would first need to have npm and node installed on your device. After that you're just a few commands away from creating a Vite environment. To get started, use the following commands in the terminal:

npm install -g vite
vite create my-project
cd my-project
npm run dev
